# HAProxy_configuration_Ansible

I've created an Ansible playbook to Configure Reverse Proxy i.e. Haproxy and update it's configuration file automatically on each time new Managed node (Configured With Apache Webserver) join the inventory. Ansible is a great tool for Configuration Management & Automation.

## Project Description
